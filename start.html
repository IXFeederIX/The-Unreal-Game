    Ok btw, this next line is made by the Author Of the Game Omar Rivero:
    -Hello, (user) this game was made by me and also ChatGPT as a main tool to help me to solve my problems
    more acurrately because i won't lie to you, making a game by myself Copy/pasting Solutions
    that are not 100% sure that they will work on a problem is not smart so i wanted to save
    time and i used ChatGPT for this, many "Developers" are using it right now as a great Coding tool
    because is fast and also Acurrate maybe this could change the programming world as we Know It!
    but who knows maybe this could replace us in no time.
    but i don't want you to discourage me for using this, it would be very egocentric on my part saying that
    i did 100% this game by myself. (Remember Work Smarter, Not Harder)
    Oh, also i might say Thanks to a Friend "K.A" for helping me to raise ideas on my mind.
    he's more like a creative Director like i told him :)
    So, Enjoy Your Travel in this Game, enjoy it as i did developing it, i learned a lot of thing from this project.
